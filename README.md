# Episode

Episode++ lets you open the latest unwatched episode of a series.

To edit/add/delete/select a series you have to activate the popup first by double clicking on the extension's icon.

To choose between added series you also can use the dropdown selection in the context menu (rightclick on the extension's icon).
(Context menu selection only supports 5 series.)

The "Episode — —" option (see context menu) allows you to decrement the episode number of the selected series.

The URLs are not stored in plaintext.
